# Site-Template
Site template for independently hosted artists website

This is an open-source artist’s database template. It is available as a google drive and HTML document and is easily adaptable to fit any artists needs. It aims to provide an alternative category scheme for those working in expanded contemporary art fields, whose work may not benefit from front-end focused web 2.0 site builders. As a protocol, these pages attempt to model some essential aspects of contemporary art practice, such as: art as a field of relations (social, historical, economic) and exhibition as the basis of extensions. Or, ideology as medium - medium as method. 

If you happen to see your name because we’ve worked on a project together (or you don’t see your name because we work on altogether too many projects) feel free to link in your content, add, or clarify data. This work is about positionality and decoherence. When I say public, it means absolutely anyone, anywhere can read, edit, or write. Consequences run very deep!

How to use: you are welcome to alter anything you like, however, in the spirit of open source, a link to the template should be included beneath “welcome visitors”. Feel free to add your name to the list of artists using this model on the last page of the document.
